# Live Database RLS Policy Analysis

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Database:** Supabase Production  
**Analysis Type:** Live Database Inspection

---

## Executive Summary

‚úÖ **GOOD NEWS:** All auth users have corresponding profiles!  
üü° **WARNING:** Multiple duplicate RLS policies detected  
‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY ISSUES:** Several tables have RLS enabled but no policies  
üîß **RECOMMENDATIONS:** Consolidate policies and fix security gaps

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Profile Status Check

### Auth Users vs Profiles

‚úÖ **ALL 6 AUTH USERS HAVE PROFILES!**

| User Email | User ID | Profile Exists | Username | Created |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------|---------|
| wildsauce313@gmail.com | b8b82111... | ‚úÖ Yes | wildsauce313@gmail.com | 2025-10-13 |
| eduv4827668@vossie.net | a3829b8a... | ‚úÖ Yes | eduv4827668@vossie.net | 2025-10-13 |
| jysnbly7@gmail.com | 9908035a... | ‚úÖ Yes | jysnbly7@gmail.com | 2025-10-09 |
| jaysonbaloyi2003@gmail.com | 0bfe742c... | ‚úÖ Yes | jaysonbaloyi2003@gmail.com | 2025-10-01 |
| mapondaglodi@gmail.com | 40544179... | ‚úÖ Yes | mapondaglodi@gmail.com | 2025-09-28 |
| mwambaandy06@gmail.com | 5646b164... | ‚úÖ Yes | mwambaandy06@gmail.com | 2025-09-28 |

**Conclusion:** The foreign key constraint issue from the analysis document is **NOT CURRENTLY A PROBLEM** because all users have profiles. However, there's **NO AUTOMATIC TRIGGER** to create profiles for new users, so this will break when new users sign up.

## üü° WARNING: Duplicate RLS Policies

### Ideas Table (9 POLICIES - TOO MANY!)

#### DELETE Policies (2 duplicates)
1. ‚úÖ `Enable delete for owners` - `auth.uid() = author`
2. ‚úÖ `Users can delete own ideas` - `auth.uid() = author`

**Analysis:** Both do the same thing. Redundant but harmless.

---

#### INSERT Policies (4 duplicates + conflicts)

1. **`Authenticated users can create ideas`**
   - Role: public
   - Check: `auth.role() = 'authenticated'`
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **INSECURE:** Doesn't verify `auth.uid() = author`

2. **`Enable authenticated users to create ideas with profile`**
   - Role: authenticated
   - Check: `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND auth.uid() = author AND EXISTS(profile)`
   - ‚úÖ **SECURE:** Checks profile exists

3. **`Enable insert access`**
   - Role: public
   - Check: `auth.uid() = author AND author IS NOT NULL AND title IS NOT NULL AND content IS NOT NULL`
   - ‚úÖ **SECURE:** Validates fields but missing category check

4. **`Enable insert for authenticated users`**
   - Role: public
   - Check: `auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND auth.uid() = author AND author IS NOT NULL AND title IS NOT NULL AND content IS NOT NULL AND category IS NOT NULL`
   - ‚úÖ **MOST SECURE:** Validates all required fields

**PROBLEM:** PostgreSQL uses OR logic between policies. This means **policy #1 allows anyone authenticated to insert ANY author ID**, bypassing the security checks in other policies.

**CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW:** A malicious user could:
```javascript
// Malicious request
await supabase.from('ideas').insert({
  author: 'some-other-users-uuid',  // ‚ùå Impersonation possible
  title: 'Fake idea',
  content: 'Posted as someone else'
});
```

This would pass policy #1 and succeed!

---

#### SELECT Policies (2 duplicates)
1. ‚úÖ `Enable read access` - `true`
2. ‚úÖ `Ideas are viewable by everyone` - `true`

**Analysis:** Redundant but harmless. Both allow public read access.

---

#### UPDATE Policies (2 duplicates)
1. ‚úÖ `Enable update for owners` - Full validation
2. ‚úÖ `Users can update own ideas` - Basic check only

**Analysis:** Policy #1 is more restrictive with field validation. Both work together via OR logic.

---

### Profiles Table (3 policies - CLEAN)

‚úÖ All policies are unique and secure:
- `Public profiles are viewable by everyone` - SELECT
- `Users can insert their own profile` - INSERT with `auth.uid() = id`
- `Users can update own profile` - UPDATE with `auth.uid() = id`

---

### Comments Table (4 policies - CLEAN)

‚úÖ All policies are unique and secure:
- `Comments are viewable by everyone` - SELECT
- `Authenticated users can create comments` - INSERT (but missing author check!)
- `Users can update own comments` - UPDATE
- `Users can delete own comments` - DELETE

‚ö†Ô∏è **SAME SECURITY ISSUE:** Insert policy only checks `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` without verifying `auth.uid() = author`

---

## üî¥ SECURITY RISKS: Tables Without Policies

### High Priority (User-Facing)

1. **`comment_likes`** - Anyone could manipulate like counts
2. **`idea_likes`** - Anyone could manipulate like counts
3. **`notifications`** - Users could read/modify other users' notifications
4. **`user_achievements`** - Users could grant themselves achievements

### Medium Priority (Admin/Content)

5. **`achievements`** - Should be admin-only write access
6. **`posts`** - Legacy table, needs policies or removal
7. **`Comments`** - Legacy table (uppercase C), needs policies or removal
8. **`Account`** - Legacy table, needs policies or removal

---

## üîç Missing Trigger Analysis

### Automatic Profile Creation

‚ùå **NO TRIGGER EXISTS** for automatic profile creation.

**Query Result:**
```
No triggers found on auth.users table
```

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Current users are fine (all 6 have profiles)
- ‚ùå **NEW USERS WILL FAIL** to submit ideas
- ‚ùå Foreign key constraint will block idea insertion

**When it will break:**
```
1. New user signs up
2. Record created in auth.users ‚úÖ
3. NO profile created in public.profiles ‚ùå
4. User tries to submit idea
5. Foreign key constraint fails ‚ùå
   ERROR: insert violates foreign key constraint "ideas_author_fkey"
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Supabase Security Advisories

### INFO Level (8 issues)

#### RLS Enabled But No Policies (4 tables)
- `public.Account`
- `public.Comments` (uppercase)
- `public.comment_likes`
- `public.posts`

**Remediation:** Add RLS policies or disable RLS if tables are unused

---

### WARN Level (6 issues)

#### Functions with Mutable Search Path (5 functions)
- `public.increment_counter`
- `public.toggle_like`
- `public.toggle_comment_like`
- `public.update_updated_at_column`
- `public.ensure_user_profile`

**Risk:** Search path injection vulnerability

**Fix:** Add `security definer set search_path = public` to each function:
```sql
create or replace function public.toggle_like(idea_id uuid)
returns void
language plpgsql
security definer set search_path = public  -- ADD THIS
as $$
...
$$;
```

---

#### Leaked Password Protection Disabled (1 issue)

**Risk:** Users can set compromised passwords

**Fix:** Enable in Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Authentication > Settings
2. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
3. This checks passwords against HaveIBeenPwned.org

## üìã Detailed RLS Policy Breakdown

### Ideas Table Policies

```sql
-- DELETE (2 duplicate policies)
"Enable delete for owners"
  USING: auth.uid() = author
  
"Users can delete own ideas"
  USING: auth.uid() = author

-- INSERT (4 policies - CONFLICTING!)
"Authenticated users can create ideas"
  TO: public
  WITH CHECK: auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  ‚ö†Ô∏è INSECURE - Missing author validation

"Enable authenticated users to create ideas with profile"
  TO: authenticated
  WITH CHECK: auth.uid() IS NOT NULL 
              AND auth.uid() = author 
              AND EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
  ‚úÖ SECURE - Validates profile exists

"Enable insert access"
  TO: public
  WITH CHECK: auth.uid() = author 
              AND author IS NOT NULL 
              AND title IS NOT NULL 
              AND content IS NOT NULL
  ‚úÖ SECURE - Good validation but missing category

"Enable insert for authenticated users"
  TO: public
  WITH CHECK: auth.role() = 'authenticated' 
              AND auth.uid() = author 
              AND author IS NOT NULL 
              AND title IS NOT NULL 
              AND content IS NOT NULL 
              AND category IS NOT NULL
  ‚úÖ MOST SECURE - Complete validation

-- SELECT (2 duplicate policies)
"Enable read access"
  USING: true

"Ideas are viewable by everyone"
  USING: true

-- UPDATE (2 policies)
"Enable update for owners"
  USING: auth.uid() = author
  WITH CHECK: auth.uid() = author 
              AND title IS NOT NULL 
              AND content IS NOT NULL 
              AND category IS NOT NULL

"Users can update own ideas"
  USING: auth.uid() = author
  WITH CHECK: (none)
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Actions

### Priority 1: CRITICAL (Do Immediately)

1. **Remove insecure INSERT policies:**
   ```sql
   DROP POLICY "Authenticated users can create ideas" ON public.ideas;
   ```

2. **Fix comments INSERT policy:**
   ```sql
   DROP POLICY "Authenticated users can create comments" ON public.comments;
   
   CREATE POLICY "comments_secure_insert"
     ON public.comments
     FOR INSERT
     TO authenticated
     WITH CHECK (
       auth.uid() = author
       AND content IS NOT NULL
       AND trim(content) != ''
     );
   ```

3. **Add RLS policies to like tables:**
   ```sql
   -- idea_likes policies
   CREATE POLICY "idea_likes_public_select"
     ON public.idea_likes FOR SELECT USING (true);
   
   CREATE POLICY "idea_likes_authenticated_insert"
     ON public.idea_likes FOR INSERT
     TO authenticated
     WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   CREATE POLICY "idea_likes_owner_delete"
     ON public.idea_likes FOR DELETE
     TO authenticated
     USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   
   -- comment_likes policies (same pattern)
   ```

---

### Priority 2: HIGH (Do Soon)

4. **Add profile creation trigger:**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user()
   RETURNS trigger
   LANGUAGE plpgsql
   SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public
   AS $$
   BEGIN
     INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, username, role)
     VALUES (new.id, new.email, 'user')
     ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
     RETURN new;
   END;
   $$;
   
   CREATE TRIGGER on_auth_user_created
     AFTER INSERT ON auth.users
     FOR EACH ROW
     EXECUTE FUNCTION public.handle_new_user();
   ```

5. **Consolidate duplicate policies:**
   - Keep only the most secure version of each policy
   - Drop duplicates

---

### Priority 3: MEDIUM (This Week)

6. **Fix function search paths:**
   ```sql
   -- For each function, add: security definer set search_path = public
   ```

7. **Add policies to notification/achievement tables**

8. **Enable leaked password protection** in Supabase Dashboard

---

### Priority 4: LOW (Cleanup)

9. **Remove or document legacy tables:** `Account`, `Comments`, `posts`

10. **Add indexes for performance** (if query performance becomes an issue)

---

## üß™ Testing Queries

### Test if user can impersonate (SHOULD FAIL after fix):
```sql
-- Try to insert idea with wrong author
-- This should fail but currently might succeed!
INSERT INTO ideas (author, title, content, category)
VALUES (
  'some-other-uuid',  -- Not your user ID
  'Test',
  'Test',
  'General'
);
```

### Verify all policies:
```sql
SELECT 
  tablename,
  policyname,
  cmd,
  roles,
  permissive
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, cmd, policyname;
```
